  <h1 class="post-title">Browsing Stackage with VS Code and Glean</h1>
  <span class="post-date">June 11, 2025</span>
  <p>Have you ever wished you could browse all the Haskell packages
together in your IDE, with full navigation using go-to-definition
and find-references? Here’s a demo of something I hacked together
while at <a href="https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2025/">ZuriHac 2025</a> over the weekend:</p>
<p><video src="../images/vscode-stackage-glean.webm" controls><a href="../images/vscode-stackage-glean.webm">Video</a></video></p>
<p>In the <a href="2025-05-22-Glean-Haskell.html">previous post</a> I talked about
how to index all of Hackage (actually Stackage, strictly speaking,
because it’s not in general possible to build all of Hackage together)
using <a href="https://glean.software">Glean</a>. Since that post I made some
more progress on the indexer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The indexer now <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/pull/532">indexes
types</a>. You can
see type-on-hover working in the demo. The types are similar to what
you see in the Haddock-generated hyperlinked source, except that
here it’s always using the type of the definition and not the type
at the usage site, which might be more specific. That’s a TODO for
later.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bunch of things, enriched the index with details about
constructors, fields and class methods, and made indexing more
efficient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The DB size including types is now about <strong>850MB</strong>, and it takes
<strong>just under 8 minutes</strong> on my 9-year-old laptop to index the nearly
3000 packages in my stackage LTS 21.21 snapshot. (Note: the figures
here were updated on 12-06-2025 when I redid the measurments).</p>
<h2 id="hooking-it-up-to-vs-code">Hooking it up to VS Code</h2>
<p>The architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/vscode-glean-arch.svg" /></p>
<p>The LSP server is a modified version of
<a href="https://github.com/josephsumabat/static-ls">static-ls</a>, which is
already designed to provide an LSP service based on static
information. I just reimplemented a few of its handlers to make calls
to Glass instead of the existing hie/hiedb implementations. You can
see the changes on <a href="https://github.com/simonmar/static-ls/commits/glean/">my fork of
static-ls</a>. Of
course, these changes are still quite hacky and not suitable for
upstreaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/Glean/tree/main/glean/glass">Glass</a>
is a “Language-agnostic Symbol Server”. Essentially it provides an API
abstraction over Glean with operations that are useful for code
navigation and search.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-next">Where to next?</h2>
<p>There remain a few issues to solve before this can be useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Make Glean more easily installable.</strong> There’s a general concensus that
<code>cabal install glean</code> would lower the barrier to entry
significantly; in order to do this we need to build the folly
dependency using Cabal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean up and ship the LSP server, somehow.</strong> Once Glean is
cabal-installable, we can depend on it from an LSP server package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about continuous integration to build the Glean
DB</strong>. Perhaps this can piggyback off the stackage CI infra? If we
can already build a complete stackage snapshot, and Glean is
easily installable, then indexing would be fairly
straightforward. I’d love to hear suggestions on how best to do
this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And looking forwards a bit further:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Think about how to handle multiple packages versions.</strong> There’s no
fundamental problem with indexing multiple package versions, except
that Glass’s SymbolID format currently doesn’t include the package
version but that’s easily fixable. We could for example build
multiple stackage LTS instances and index them all in a single Glean
DB. There would be advantages to doing this, if for instance there
were packages in common between two Stackage instances then the
Glean DB would only contain a single copy. A lot of the type
structure would be shared too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide search functionality in the LSP.</strong> Glean can provide
simple textual search for names, and with some work could also
provide Hoogle-like type search.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about how to index local projects and local changes</strong>. Glean
supports <em>stacked</em> and
<a href="https://glean.software/blog/incremental/"><em>incremental</em></a> DBs, so we
could build a DB for a local project stacked on top of the full
Stackage DB. You would be able to go-to-definition directly from
a file in your project to the packages it depends on in
Stackage. We could re-index new <code>.hie</code> files as they are
generated, rather like how static-ls currently handles changes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate with HLS?</strong> Perhaps Glean could be used to handle
references outside of the current project, switching seamlessly
from GHC-based navigation to Glean-based navigation if you jump
into a non-local package.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="more-use-cases">More use cases?</h2>
<p>I talked with a few people at ZuriHac about potential use cases for
Glean within the Haskell ecosystem. Using it in <code>haskell.org</code> came up
a few times, as a way to power search, navigation and analysis. Also
mentioned was the possibility of using it as a Hoogle
backend. Potentially we could replace the Haddock-generated
hyperlinked sources on <code>haskell.org</code> with a Glean-based browser, which
would allow navigating links between packages and find-references.</p>
<p>Another use cases that came up was the possibility of doing impact
analysis for core library changes (or any API changes really). Some of
this is already possible using find-references, but more complex cases
such as finding instances that override certain methods aren’t
possible yet until we extend the indexer to capture richer
information.</p>
