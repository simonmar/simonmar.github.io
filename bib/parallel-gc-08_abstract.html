>We present a parallel generational-copying garbage collector
implemented for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.  We use a
block-structured memory allocator, which provides a natural
granularity for dividing the work of GC between many threads, leading
to a simple yet effective method for parallelising copying GC.  The
results are encouraging: we demonstrate wall-clock speedups of on
average a factor of 2 in GC time on a commodity 4-core machine with no
programmer intervention, compared to our best sequential GC.
