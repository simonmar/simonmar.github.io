>Though Haskell is predominantly type-safe, implementations contain a
few loopholes through which code can bypass typing and module
encapsulation.  This paper presents Safe Haskell, a language
extension that closes these loopholes.  Safe Haskell makes it possible
to confine and safely execute untrusted, possibly malicious code.  By
strictly enforcing types, Safe Haskell allows a variety of different
policies from API sandboxing to information-flow control to be
implemented easily as monads. Safe Haskell is aimed to be as
unobtrusive as possible. It enforces properties that programmers tend
to meet already by convention. We describe the design of Safe Haskell
and an implementation (currently shipping with GHC) that infers safety
for code that lies in a safe subset of the language.  We use Safe
Haskell to implement an online Haskell interpreter that can securely
execute arbitrary untrusted code with no overhead. The use of Safe
Haskell greatly simplifies this task and allows the use of a large
body of existing code and tools.
