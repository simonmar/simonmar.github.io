>Functional programming languages are an ideal medium for program
optimisations based on source-to-source transformation techniques.
Referential transparency affords opportunities for a wide range of
correctness-preserving transformations leading to potent optimisation
strategies.
</P
><P
>This thesis builds on deforestation, a program transformation
technique due to Wadler that removes intermediate data structures from
first-order functional programs.
</P
><P
>Our contribution is to reformulate deforestation for higher-order
functional programming languages, and to show that the resulting
algorithm terminates given certain syntactic and typing constraints on
the input.  These constraints are entirely reasonable, indeed it is
possible to translate any typed program into the required syntactic
form.  We show how this translation can be performed automatically and
optimally.
</P
><P
>The higher-order deforestation algorithm is {\em transparent}.  That
is, it is possible to determine by examination of the source program
where the optimisation will be applicable.
</P
><P
>We also investigate the relationship of deforestation to
cut-elimination, the normalisation property for the logic of sequent
calculus.  By combining a cut-elimination algorithm and first-order
deforestation, we derive an improved higher-order deforestation
algorithm.
</P
><P
>The higher-order deforestation algorithm has been implemented in the
Glasgow Haskell Compiler.  We describe how deforestation fits into the
framework of Haskell, and design a model for the implementation that
allows automatic list removal, with additional deforestation being
performed on the basis of programmer supplied annotations.  Results
from applying the deforestation implementation to several example
Haskell programs are given.
