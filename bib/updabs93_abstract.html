>A requirement  of lazy    evaluation  is that     the value
of any subexpression in the program is calculated no more than once.
This is achieved by updating an expression with its value, once
computed.  The problem is that updating is a costly operation, and
experimentation has shown that it is only necessary in about 30\% of
cases (that is, 70\% of expressions represent values that are only
ever required once during execution).  The aim of the analysis
presented in this paper is to discover expressions that do not need to
be updated, and thus reduce the execution time of the program.  The
analysis has been implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and
results are given.
