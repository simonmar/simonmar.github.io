>Haskell's type classes allow ad-hoc overloading, or typeindexing,
of functions. A natural generalisation is to allow
type-indexing of data types as well. It turns out that this
idea directly supports a powerful form of abstraction called
associated types, which are available in C++ using traits
classes. Associated types are useful in many applications,
especially for self-optimising libraries that adapt their data
representations and algorithms in a type-directed manner.

>In this paper, we introduce and motivate associated types
as a rather natural generalisation of Haskell's existing type
classes. Formally, we present a type system that includes
a type-directed translation into an explicitly typed target
language akin to System F; the existence of this translation
ensures that the addition of associated data types to an
existing Haskell compiler only requires changes to the front
end.
