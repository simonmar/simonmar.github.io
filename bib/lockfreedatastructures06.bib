   abstract = {This paper explores the feasibility of re-expressing concurrent
algorithms with explicit locks in terms of lock free code written
using Haskell's implementation of software transactional
memory. Experimental results are presented which show that for
multi-processor systems the simpler lock free implementations offer
superior performance when compared to their corresponding lock based
implementations.
