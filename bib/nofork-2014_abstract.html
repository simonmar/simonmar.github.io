>We describe a new programming idiom for concurrency, based on
Applicative Functors, where concurrency is implicit in the Applica-
tive &lt;*&gt; operator. The result is that concurrent programs can be
written in a natural applicative style, and they retain a high degree
of clarity and modularity while executing with maximal concur-
rency. This idiom is particularly useful for programming against
external data sources, where the application code is written without
the use of explicit concurrency constructs, while the implementa-
tion is able to batch together multiple requests for data from the
same source, and fetch data from multiple sources concurrently.
Our abstraction uses a cache to ensure that multiple requests for
the same data return the same result, which frees the programmer
from having to arrange to fetch data only once, which in turn leads
to greater modularity.

>While it is generally applicable, our technique was designed
with a particular application in mind: an internal service at Face-
book that identifies particular types of content and takes actions
based on it. Our application has a large body of business logic that
fetches data from several different external sources. The framework
described in this paper enables the business logic to execute ef-
ficiently by automatically fetching data concurrently; we present
some preliminary results.
