   abstract = {This paper describes Haddock, a tool for automatically generating
documentation from Haskell source code.  Haddock's unique approach to
source code annotations provides a useful separation between the
implementation of a library and the interface (and hence also the
documentation) of that library, so that as far as possible the
documentation annotations in the source code do not affect the
programmer's freedom over the structure of the implementation.  The
internal structure and implementation of Haddock is also discussed.
