>Every now and then, a user of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler asks for a feature that requires specialised support from the
storage manager.  Memo functions, pointer equality, external pointers,
finalizers, and weak pointers, are all examples.
</P
><P
>We take memo functions as our exemplar because they turn out to be the
trickiest to support.  We present no fewer than four distinct
mechanisms that are needed to support memo tables, and that (in
various combinations) satisfy a variety of other needs.
</P
><P
>The resulting set of primitives is undoubtedly powerful and useful.
Whether they are {\em too} powerful is not yet clear.  While the focus
of our discussion is on Haskell, there is nothing Haskell-specific
about most of the primitives, which could readily be used in other
settings.
