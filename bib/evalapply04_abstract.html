>Higher-order languages that encourage currying are implemented using
one of two basic evaluation models: push/enter or
eval/apply. Implementors use their intuition and qualitative
judgements to choose one model or the other.Our goal in this paper is
to provide, for the first time, a more substantial basis for this
choice, based on our qualitative and quantitative experience of
implementing both models in a state-of-the-art compiler for
Haskell.Our conclusion is simple, and contradicts our initial
intuition: compiled implementations should use eval/apply.
